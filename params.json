  "body": "# hwy3\r\n--\r\nhwy3 is an http server for distributing a stream, like an mp3 feed, to many\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nClients receive whatever hwy3 receives on stdin after they connect.\r\n\r\nClients that receive data too slowly will miss some segments of the stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example\r\n\r\nClients connect to port 80 and receive random bytes. (Don't do this.)\r\n\r\n    hwy3 </dev/urandom\r\n\r\n\r\n### PCM Radio Station\r\n\r\nClients receive raw PCM data. Clients that receive data too slowly will miss\r\nmultiples of 1000 bytes, so they don't lose sync.\r\n\r\n    arecord --device default:0 --format cd --file-type raw \\\r\n        | hwy3 -listen :44100 -chunk 1000 -mime-type \"audio/L16; rate=44100; channels=2\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### MP3 Radio Station\r\n\r\nClients receive MP3 frames. Clients that receive data too slowly will miss\r\nentire MP3 frames, so they don't lose sync.\r\n\r\n    curl --retry 9999999 --retry-delay 1 http://0.0.0.0:44100/ \\\r\n        | lame -r -h -b 128 - - \\\r\n        | hwy3 -listen :12800 -mp3\r\n\r\n\r\n### Log Messages\r\n\r\nhwy3 prints a log message on stderr whenever a client connects or disconnects.\r\n\r\n    2016/02/08 00:39:12.371135 3 +\"127.0.0.1:48663\"\r\n\r\nA client connected (\"+\") from 127.0.0.1 port 48663, for a total of 3 clients\r\nconnected now.\r\n\r\n    2016/02/08 00:39:20.478136 2 -\"127.0.0.1:48663\" 8.107070208s 127831 =15767B/s \"\"\r\n\r\nThe client at 127.0.0.1:48663 disconnected (\"-\"). 2 other clients are still\r\nconnected.
